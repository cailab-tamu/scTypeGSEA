This package is used to label the cell type for single-cell data. For single-cell data set, the package “Seurat” is used to do data process and cluster, after clustering the cell, one needs to label the cell type for each cluster. The “GSEA” is one method to label the cell type, but the cell type database for the original “GSEA” method is too old. This package will label cell type by “GSEA” method for single- cell data set after “Seurat” cluster but with a new complete cell type database.
